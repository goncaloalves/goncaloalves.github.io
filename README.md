# Gonçalo Oliveira Alves's Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for the personal website of Gonçalo Oliveira Alves, available at [goncalooliveiraalves.com](http.goncalooliveiraalves.com/).

## About

This is a simple, static website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The goal was to create a good-looking, secure, and fast website at no cost.

## Tech Stack

*   **Domain:** Dreamhost
*   **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
*   **Static Site Generator:** Jekyll

This setup was chosen for its security benefits (no database), performance (static files), and ease of deployment (a simple `git push`).

## Custom Domain

This website uses a custom domain `www.goncalooliveiraalves.com`. GitHub Pages is configured to use this domain via the `CNAME` file in this repository. As a result, the default GitHub Pages URL `goncaloalves.github.io` automatically redirects to the custom domain.
